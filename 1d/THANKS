This project was led by the understanding of the Burger's equation,
most of which I learned through Bruno Lehouque's work.

Special thanks to him for his patience, and his sharp analysis and
deep understanding of the Physics behind the use-case.

This work is largely inspired from [Raissi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10561).
